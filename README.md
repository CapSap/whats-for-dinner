# What's for dinner?

## Description

This is an app to help Rika decide on what to eat / make for dinner
This app must works on iOs because Rika uses iPhone

## Overall goal:
As a home cook and busy adult, I want to simplify meal planning, so that I can quickly decide what to eat without overthinking.

## Planned MVP app structure:
The app will have 3 screens: 
1. Home screen (where user can swipe recipes cards)
2. Recipe details screen (user view go to a receipe details screen, scroll and view details)
3. User can add a recipe

## User stories
### Home screen
- As a user, I want to flick through my successful recipes in a swipeable format so that I can quickly decide what to cook.
- As a user, I want to see a photo attached to each recipe so that I can easily visualize my meal.
- As a user, I want a "randomize" button that picks a recipe for me so that I don't overthink my dinner choice.

### Recipe Details Screen

- As a user, I want to tap on a recipe card to view its full details so that I can see ingredients and instructions.
- As a user, I want to be able to scroll through a recipeâ€™s details smoothly so that I can easily follow the steps.

### Adding & Categorizing Recipes

- As a user, I want to add a new recipe if I try one and find it successful so that I can keep track of meals that work.
- As a user, I want to categorize my recipes into two groups:
    Homemade: Recipes I have successfully made.
    Inspiration: Recipes I want to try (e.g., from restaurants).
- As a user, I want to be able to add a link for an "Inspiration" recipe so that I can refer to it later.
- As a user, I want to move an "Inspiration" recipe to "Homemade" once I successfully make it so that I can track my progress.
